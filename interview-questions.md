# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is how we use version control to share and collaborate creating code. Github is the repository that stores the code.

Researched answer: Git is a version control tool used to save code to a local drive and uses commands such as push and pull, commit, reset, fetch, and merge to save changes. GitHub is system where repositories are created with unique urls and give the place where files are stored in a graphical interface.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: An operator that would have an output of true or false.

Researched answer: Logical operators such as && (and) or || (or). When || (or) is used, if any part of the arguments are true then it returns a true output.  When && (and) is used, both arguments have to be true to return a true output.  If any argument is false then it will return a false output. 

3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The index is the position the data is at in the array, defined by a number starting from zero. The value is the actual data that is listed in the array.

Researched answer: An array's index is the ordered location of a value within the array.  The value is the data being listed in the array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are different data types grouped together. String is one data type. 

Researched answer: Both are used to store data and could use an index.  String is a primative data type. Arrays use different data types that could include strings. Arrays can use mutators to change their values and strings cannot.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming include a driver and a navigator. The driver is the partner physically typing in the code while getting input and direction from the navigator.  The navigator is guiding and assisting the driver by giving them instruction and also double checking the driver's work. The navigator and driver then switch positions and share their code through uploading to their repository in GitHub. 

Researched answer: In addition to my answer stated above, I also learned that pair programming realies heavily on clear communication and attention to detail.  Also that switching often help to decrese developer fatigue. The goal of pair programming is using computer an keyboard to collaborate together on one project.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Takes a function as an argument such as .map and .filter to execute iteration

2. Jest: An open-sourced framework created by Facebook and used to test javascript code

3. Objects: Data type stored in curly braces and consist of keys and values

4. Method: A function that is associated with an object

5. Classes: Templates for creating objects by including two or more arguments as one instance
